## Project Description

By the end of this project, I will have developed a full informative webpage showcasing the projects that I have participated in. The target audience will be potential employers, peers who wish to see my work and possibly collaborate, and those who may just be curious to see what I've worked on.

Definition of success: Those who look at my website have an immediate impression of my skills and skill level, are easily and directly able to see my projects and get an immediate understanding of what they are at a glance. Users will be able to dig deeper, only if they want to, to gain more details about what went into each project and more specific components that were leveraged to make the finished products.

## Google Sheet

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oVPq9iIy7lclUAgZLIBaJSXGHU4IIpGdERTxXm4l7vk/edit#gid=0)  is a link to my google sheet used as the CMS for the project 

## Portfolio I want to Emulate

Below is a list of a few portfolios that caught my eye that I plan on using for style inspiration:

Link To Site  | One Thing I'd Like To Incorporate | 
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Google slides pastel portfolio template](https://slidesgo.com/theme/pastel-portfolio)| Not a site, but a similar style feel that I really like.
|[Ink Elegant Magazine Blog Template](https://themeforest.net/item/ink-elegant-magazine-blog-psd-template/12135937) | I love these colors, font, simplicity, and the use of artwork |
| [http://www.mypoorbrain.com/](http://www.mypoorbrain.com/) |  This card layout is close to exactly what I'm looking for
|[https://www.polarsundesigns.com/store](https://www.polarsundesigns.com/store)| I probably won't actually implement any of this, I just thought it was dope.

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Do not include the actual image and have it render on the page.

## Time/Priority Matrix 

[Time/Priority Matrix](https://i.imgur.com/PWVuN6y.jpg)

Please see in the link above the features listed to implement as part of this project, listed out in an ordered list. Each component has been added to the matrix and assigned based on an estimate of its priority and how long it will take to implement. If any one feature takes longer than 3hrs to complete then I have broken it down into smaller tasks and reassigned them a new letter. 

Once complete tally up the time and determine how long the project will take to complete. Now break those features into MVP and PostMVP so you can guarantee you will have a fully functioning project to demo. 

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min
MVP
* Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS, adhering to best practices.
* Use CSS GRID to create a multi-column layout
* Use Flexbox for content
* Must be mobile mobile first, then tablet and desktop responsive
* Must pull in projects via API call from google sheet
* Be deployed and accessible online either via Github Pages or Surge.
* Pre-work deliverables: Mobile Wireframes, Desktop Wireframes, Timeline, Priority Matrix
* CMS fully completed with information

Post-MVP
* Add secondary more detailed project information to your google sheet and your render
* Add a sort field to your google sheet and your render
* CSS Embellishmenst and animations
* Add an optional photography section
	* Make a new photography CMS
	* Render photography elements on the page
* Add a personality section, whether that be for outdoors trips, personal goals in progress, books you're reading, something to show off who you actually are



## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

* Page Indexing - 10 minutes
* Project Card Sorting - 1 hour
* Project Detailed View - 2 hours
* CMS Information Render - 3 hours
